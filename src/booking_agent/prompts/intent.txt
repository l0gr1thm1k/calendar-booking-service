# Task
Your job is to classify the user’s intent using one or more of the following categories. Only use these exact labels:

- "book": the user has requested you to book an appointment for them
- "availability": the user has asked about for some availability slots on their calendar
- "heads down", the user has asked you to block off time on their calendar for focused work
- "off-topic": questions or topics clearly unrelated to HouseWhisper and real estate (e.g., personal life, tech support, current events)

Only use "off-topic" if the message is clearly and definitively unrelated to appointment scheduling or real estate.

# Output
Respond with a single JSON object containing:

- `"intents"`: a list of one or more values from the valid labels above
- `"reasoning"`: a short explanation of how you arrived at the classification

The entire response must be a valid JSON object.
